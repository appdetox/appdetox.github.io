About
-----

AppDetox helps you to calm down your mobile app usage. You are able to set your own rules for your app usage to detox from some heavy app usage and stop procrastinating. According to your own rules the use of some apps will be forbidden. You will see temptations when you tried to launch an app against your rules in a log. You will also see a statistic of your daily app usage as well as total usage time and number of launches for your apps.
